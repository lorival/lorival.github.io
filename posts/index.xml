      <description>The English language is fundamental to every technology professional. How to start developing this skill saving money?
According to a well-known Brazilian magazine only 5% of Brazilians are fluent in Englishs, it&amp;rsquo;s incredible how many English schools there are in Brazil and so few fluent people, not to mention that 65% of them say they do not study because it is expensive.
I&amp;rsquo;m not fluent in English, so I&amp;rsquo;m not part of these 5%, but I&amp;rsquo;d like like to share some study tips that I used or I use today to continue improving my English without necessarily going to a regular school.</description>
